Programas para comparar fotos que estan en SD o celular contra un repositorio 
ordenado por a√±os 


Just for the benefit of the non-spanish speaking community: 
This project is about tracking the pictures stored on a SD card, pen drive, 
camera or cell phone and comparing them to the already existing repository which 
is ordered by year and then by YYYY-MM-DD_some_description 
More explanation comming soon.

It was for no reason that I started writing and documenting these 
scripts in spanish; Bad choice as during most of my career, 
I used to document everything in english. 
I believe it's because I'm becoming old...
